# WZTBot: The [MusicBot](https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot) for Discord with some proprietary features for our server.

### MusicBot

MusicBot is a Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It plays requested songs and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs.

All credits goes to the original developers for the [bot](https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot) for wrinting all the code that we didn't.

### Our Modifications

We modified the bot to add some features for our Discord Server. This features are related to the our CS:GO players' scorings, for now; there may be more to come.

### Our Community

We are a small Romanian community. You can find more about us on our [website](https://www.wzt.ro), or you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RW4UavD "Join Discord"), where you will find this modded bot.
